## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.17 or later)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omprakash24d/Driving-School-Arwal.git
cd Driving-School-Arwal
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file to create your own local configuration:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, open the `.env` file and fill in the required credentials. This is the most crucial step.

| Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` | Your Firebase project's web app configuration keys. Found in Project Settings > General in the Firebase console. |
| `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` | A JSON key for the Firebase Admin SDK. Generate this in Project Settings > Service Accounts. **Keep this secret!** |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Your Google AI Platform API key for Genkit. Enable the "Generative Language API" in Google Cloud. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | Your Google Maps Embed API key. Enable "Maps Embed API" in Google Cloud. |
| `SMTP_USER` / `SMTP_PASS` | Your Gmail address and an "App Password" for Nodemailer. [How to generate an App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833). |
| `FROM_EMAIL` / `TO_EMAIL` | The email address to send notifications from and to (for admin notifications). |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SCHOOL_NAME` | The name of your driving school. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAILS` | A comma-separated list of emails that will have admin access. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | The public URL of your deployed application (e.g., `https://drivingschoolarwal.in`). |

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:9002`.

## 👑 Admin Panel

The admin panel is the central control hub for the application.

-   **Access:** The admin panel is located at `/admin`.
-   **Authentication:** Access is restricted based on the `adminEmails` list in your Firestore `settings/siteConfiguration` document. The first time you run the app, set your email in the `.env` file (`NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAILS`).
-   **Seeding Data:** After your first login, navigate to the **Settings** page in the admin panel. Use the "Seed Default Data" buttons to populate your Firestore database with sample courses, instructors, and testimonials. This is essential for the application to function correctly.
