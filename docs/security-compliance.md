# DriveRight - Security & Compliance Guide

## üîí Security Framework

### Authentication & Authorization

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- **Implementation**: Firebase Auth with phone verification
- **Admin Access**: Mandatory MFA for admin accounts
- **Student Access**: Optional MFA with email/SMS verification

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

```typescript
// User Roles Hierarchy
- Super Admin: Full system access
- Admin: Course management, user oversight
- Instructor: Course delivery, student assessment
- Student: Course access, personal data management
```

#### Session Management

- **Session Timeout**: 24 hours for students, 8 hours for admin
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Limited to 3 per user
- **Session Invalidation**: Automatic on password change

### Data Protection

#### Encryption at Rest

- **Database**: Firestore native encryption (AES-256)
- **File Storage**: Firebase Storage encryption
- **Local Storage**: Sensitive data encrypted with AES-256-GCM

#### Encryption in Transit

- **HTTPS**: TLS 1.3 minimum for all connections
- **API Communications**: End-to-end encryption
- **File Uploads**: Encrypted transmission with integrity checks

#### Personal Data Classification

```typescript
// Data Sensitivity Levels
1. Public: Course information, instructor profiles
2. Internal: Enrollment statistics, aggregated data
3. Confidential: Student records, payment information
4. Restricted: Admin credentials, audit logs
5. Highly Restricted: Biometric data, SSN, driver's license
```

### GDPR Compliance

   - Admin verification for sensitive changes
   - Audit trail for all modifications

3. **Right to Erasure (Article 17)**

   - Request processing: 30 days maximum
   - Data anonymization where deletion not possible
   - Legal hold consideration for regulatory requirements

4. **Right to Data Portability (Article 20)**
   - Export formats: JSON, CSV, PDF
   - Includes all user-generated content
   - Structured data format for import to other systems

#### Consent Management

- **Granular Consent**: Separate opt-ins for different processing purposes
- **Consent Withdrawal**: One-click withdrawal with immediate effect
- **Consent Records**: Immutable audit trail with timestamps and IP addresses
- **Age Verification**: Enhanced consent for minors (under 16)

#### Privacy by Design

- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data

- **Storage Limitation**: Automatic deletion after retention period
- **Pseudonymization**: Replace identifiers where possible

### Audit & Compliance

#### Audit Logging

```typescript
// Audit Event Types
- User Authentication (login, logout, failed attempts)
- Data Access (view, download, export)
- Data Modification (create, update, delete)
- Administrative Actions (user role changes, system configuration)
- Security Events (suspicious activity, policy violations)
```

#### Compliance Monitoring

- **Real-time Alerts**: Unusual access patterns, data breaches
- **Regular Audits**: Monthly security reviews, quarterly compliance checks
- **Automated Scanning**: Daily vulnerability scans, weekly penetration testing
- **Incident Response**: 72-hour notification requirement for data breaches

#### Data Retention Policy

```typescript
// Retention Periods by Data Type
- Student Records: 7 years (regulatory requirement)
- Payment Information: 7 years (tax compliance)
- Audit Logs: 10 years (security compliance)
- Marketing Data: Until consent withdrawal
- Anonymous Analytics: 2 years
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Controls

### Input Validation & Sanitization

- **Server-side Validation**: All inputs validated on server
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries only
- **XSS Prevention**: Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- **File Upload Security**: Type validation, virus scanning, size limits

### Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection

- **API Rate Limiting**: Per-user and per-IP limits
- **Brute Force Protection**: Account lockout after failed attempts
- **Geographic Blocking**: Block high-risk countries
- **CDN Protection**: Cloudflare or similar for DDoS mitigation

### Infrastructure Security

- **Firewall Configuration**: Whitelist-only approach
- **Network Segmentation**: Separate environments for dev/staging/prod
- **Regular Updates**: Automated security patches
- **Backup Security**: Encrypted backups with air-gap storage

### Application Security

- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability scans of NPM packages
- **Code Analysis**: Static code analysis in CI/CD pipeline
- **Error Handling**: No sensitive information in error messages
- **Secure Headers**: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options implementation

## üìã Compliance Frameworks

### Educational Data Privacy

#### FERPA Compliance (US)

- **Student Consent**: Required for disclosure of educational records
- **Directory Information**: Limited public information with opt-out
- **Access Controls**: Students have right to access their records
- **Third-party Sharing**: Strict limitations and agreements required

#### COPPA Compliance (Under 13)

- **Parental Consent**: Required for data collection from minors
- **Limited Data Collection**: Only what's necessary for service provision
- **Third-party Restrictions**: No behavioral advertising to children

## üö® Incident Response Plan

### Security Incident Classification

2. **Hour 1-4**: Containment and preliminary investigation
3. **Hour 4-24**: Full investigation and impact assessment
4. **Hour 24-72**: Regulatory notification and user communication
5. **Post-72**: Remediation and lessons learned

#### Communication Plan
